## Self-Assessment

- Despite the fact that we only fail one private test on the final checkpoint (cp1: 100%, cp2: 100%, cpf: 99.39%), we think we deserve 20 because we had a very strong overall performance. Also, the private tests do not necessarily cover all the possible cases of either wrong or correct inputs, as we solved a lot of issues with cases where the compiler was not behaving as expected and it did not reflect on the percentage of the tests going up, which means that if we were lucky that one of those cases were one of the private tests the percentage would have gone up.

## Implemented optimizations

Without any flags the following optimizations will always occur:

- Jasmin low cost instructions

Using the `-r <n>` flag, the following optimizations will occur:

- Register allocation

Using the `-o` flag, the following optimizations will occur:

- Constant folding
- Constant propagation

## Extra Elements

- Method calls from imported classes can be used anywhere;
