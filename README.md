## Self-Assessment

- Despite we only fail one private test (cp1: 100%, cp2: 100%, cpf: 99.39%), we think we deserve 20 because we had a very strong overall performance.

## Implemented optimizations

Without any flags the following optimizations will always occur:

- Jasmin low cost instructions

Using the `-r <n>` flag, the following optimizations will occur:

- Register allocation

Using the `-o` flag, the following optimizations will occur:

- Constant folding
- Constant propagation

## Extra Elements

- Method calls from imported classes can be used anywhere;
